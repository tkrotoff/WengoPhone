Known Bugs

WengoAddIncludePath(['include'])
results in:
/Idebug\libs\qtutil\include /Ilibs\qtutil\include
SCons seems to be buggy on this point when duplicate=0

Under MacOSX it does not copy the .app file inside the build directory,
only the UNIX application.

for flag in flags:
	#This does not work under MacOSX
	#because of -framework QtGui blah blah...
	#if not flag in env['LINKFLAGS']:
		env.Append(LINKFLAGS = flag)

WengoSCons starts to be quite stable.
