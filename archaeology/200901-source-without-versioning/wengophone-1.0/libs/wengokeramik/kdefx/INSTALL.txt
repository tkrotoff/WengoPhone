Make sure you have setup QTDIR to the right directory (e.g. c:\QT)

open a command prompt and do:

qmake 
nmake

Currently this has only been tested with MSVC++ V7+ 
(KDElibs might not compile with other compilers)

KDEFX DLL is installed in $(QTDIR)\bin.

In order to deploy these styles with your applications you need to put the kdefx.dll
in the same folder as your application and any styles you want into a folder called
"styles" located at the root of you application. 

E.g. if you app is called "myapp.exe" and located in "c:\apps" then here's what you should
get:

c:\apps\myapp.exe
c:\apps\kdefx.dll
c:\apps\styles\kcomixstyle.dll
c:\apps\styles\....
