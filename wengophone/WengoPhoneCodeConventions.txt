WengoPhone Code Conventions
---------------------------

Please read the file WengoPhoneCodeConventions.odt or go to the wiki page
http://dev.openwengo.com/trac/openwengo/trac.cgi/wiki/WengoPhoneCodeConventions

This document only explain specific conventions for WengoPhoneNG

** Model component
All classes are named after WengoPhoneCodeConventions.sxw
All thread safe methods are named *ThreadSafe().
Events are always postfixed with Event and event callbacks with EventHandler
Besides this there is no specific conventions for this component.

** Control component
This component has some special conventions:
all classes start with a big letter 'C' (meaning Control) e.g CWengoPhone.

** Presentation component
All classes start with a big letter 'P' (meaning Presentation) e.g PWengoPhone.
All Qt classes start with 'Qt' e.g QtWengoPhone
All GTK+ classes start with 'Gtk' e.g GtkWengoPhone
ect...

Qt classes have to be thread safe. All the calls from the model/control part
should be threaded via QObjectThreadSafe (LibQtUtil).
If a method addMessage(const std::string & message) is implemented inside a Qt class,
this method should call another one named addMessageThreadSafe() that uses QObjectThreadSafe
Same for the constructor that calls a method named initThreadSafe().
So all thread safe methods are named *ThreadSafe().

For UML pictures the resolution should be 1280x960 (~100KB)
Name convention: $MODULE_framework1.jpg, $MODULE_framework2.jpg ...
