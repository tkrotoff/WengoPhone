WengoPhoneNG is a free voice over Internet phone under the GNU GPL license.
WengoPhoneNG is at a very early stage of development.

WengoPhoneNG is developed in C++.
The core application is totally separated from the graphical representation.
This is achieved via PAC, a kind of MVC pattern.

The source code is organized as followed:

** Model
The core application coded in pure C++
using STL, Boost and some internal libraries (check libutil-ng).
All the "intelligence" is inside this component.
You must be familiar with common design patterns
like Singleton, Factory, Observer, State, Command, Memento
Inside the model component, SIP stack implementation can be plugged
and run in parallel.

** Control
Control component (like in the MVC pattern).
Almost no "intelligence".

** Presentation
Graphical representation of the model.
There is no "intelligence" whatsoever.
Can be implemented using Qt, GTK or whatever toolkit you prefer.
For now we focus on a Qt interface.


UML diagrams (*.wmf) are generated using Borland Together Architect
and are placed inside the together directory.

The documentation is generated using doxygen (or Borland Together).
Everything is inside the doc directory.
