** GTK interface (already started to make a proof of concept with PAC)
(Easy)
Check softphone-ng/src/presentation/gtk/ and
playground/demopac/counter/src/presentation/gtk/

** Port under other OS
(Easy) --> Done using NullSipWrapper
Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, Solaris...
WinCE (Difficult)

** Debian, RPM, NSIS installer scripts
(Easy)
Check softphone-ng/debian/, softphone-ng/rpm/, softphone-ng/nsis/
and softphone/trunk/deb-installer/, softphone/trunk/rpm-installer/,
softphone/trunk/installer/ for code

** SMS
(Easy)
Implementations already done in playground/demopac/sms/ and in softphone/trunk/gui/sms/

** Tests
(Easy)
Using http://boost.org/libs/test/doc/index.html
-> for libutil, libqtutil, libsound, softphone-ng/model, softphone-ng/control

** Check memory leaks
(Difficult)
There are a lot right now
See BoundsChecker and Valgrind

** Implement IAX using IAXClient besides phApi and sipX
(Difficult)
Read documentation from softphone-ng/src/model/sipwrapper/SipWrapper.h
See http://iaxclient.sourceforge.net/

** Use OPAL besides phApi and sipX
(Difficult)
Read documentation from softphone-ng/src/model/sipwrapper/SipWrapper.h
See http://www.openh323.org/

** Call history
(Difficult)
Call history should be implemented inside softphone-ng/src/model/history
following the design from softphone-csharp/Model/History/

** Presence
(Difficult)
Partially implemented inside softphone-ng/src/model/presence
Needs more work with code taken from softphone/trunk/gui/presence/

** Systray icon

Port trayicon class to Qt 4.0

** Configuration panel
(Difficult)
Design has to be re-think with serialization and so one.
